**IT Operations**: Emphasize the offline-first architecture and click-to-deploy installers. Walk through the Docker Compose deployment from `docs/deployment.md` and highlight the systemd service management for production reliability.

**Compliance Officers**: Highlight the audit logging capabilities and data residency enforcement. Use the GDPR example from `docs/getting-started.md` to show how policies prevent non-compliant data transfers.

**DevOps Engineers**: Dive into the Policy DSL and version control features. Demonstrate the test simulator and deployment workflow from `docs/policy-builder-ui.md` to show how policies integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

**Site Managers**: Showcase the Tauri UI simplicity. Guide them through tenant creation and policy deployment using the step-by-step instructions from `docs/getting-started.md`.

## Narrative Structure

A compelling presentation follows a clear narrative arc that takes the audience from problem awareness to solution adoption.

### Opening Hook

Start with a powerful statement that resonates with edge compliance challenges:

> "In today's distributed world, traditional centralized policy systems fail when devices roam, links are intermittent, or data residency requirements demand local enforcement. Edge Policy Hub solves this by bringing policy enforcement to the edge."

Reference the core problem from `README.md`: scattered policy enforcement across firewalls, proxies, scripts, and application code.

### Problem Statement

Articulate the pain points using concrete use cases:

- **Scattered Enforcement**: Policies implemented inconsistently across different systems
- **Compliance Surfaces**: Data locality and offline operation requirements
- **Multi-Tenant Challenges**: Hard isolation needed at the edge
- **Operational Complexity**: Manual policy management and deployment

### Solution Introduction

Introduce Edge Policy Hub around its key differentiators:

- Multi-tenant isolation with hard separation between tenants
- ABAC policy model supporting rich attribute-based decisions
- OPA/Rego enforcement with sub-2ms latency
- Click-to-deploy Tauri installer for desktop management
- Offline-first operation for disconnected environments

### Architecture Overview

Use the mermaid diagram from the [High-Level Flow section in README.md](../README.md#high-level-flow) as your visual aid. Walk through the flow:

1. Operators author policies using the Tauri UI
2. Policies compile to OPA/Rego bundles
3. Bundles deploy to enforcer service
4. Enforcer makes real-time decisions for HTTP proxy and MQTT bridge
5. Audit store captures all decisions for compliance

### Feature Deep-Dive

Present each major feature with concrete examples:

**Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Reference the tenant creation workflow from the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md). Show how each tenant gets isolated policy namespaces, dedicated OPA bundles, and separate audit logs.

**ABAC Policies**: Use the EU data residency example from the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md):

```dsl
allow read resource.type == "customer_data"
if environment.country in ["DE", "FR", "GB"]
  and environment.time.hour >= 9
  and environment.time.hour <= 17
```

**Data Residency**: Reference the GDPR use case from the [Use Cases section in README.md](../README.md#use-cases), demonstrating how policies enforce geographic data boundaries.

**Cost Guardrails**: Reference the bandwidth quota example from the [Use Cases section in README.md](../README.md#use-cases), showing how policies prevent cost overruns through automated enforcement.

### Live Demo Transition

> "Now that we've covered the architecture, let me show you Edge Policy Hub in action. I'll walk through creating a tenant, authoring a policy, and seeing real-time enforcement."

### Closing and Call-to-Action

End with a strong close:

> "Edge Policy Hub transforms edge compliance from a complex challenge into a manageable, automated process. Ready to see how it can solve your edge policy challenges?"

Provide clear next steps: trial deployment, POC engagement, or documentation review.

## Value Proposition Communication

### Edge-First Compliance

Edge Policy Hub uniquely addresses edge compliance challenges that traditional systems can't handle. Reference the [Why Edge Policy Hub? section in README.md](../README.md#why-edge-policy-hub):

- **Data Residency**: Enforce geographic boundaries at the edge
- **Offline Operation**: Continue functioning without cloud connectivity
- **Latency-Sensitive Decisions**: Sub-2ms enforcement for real-time applications

### Unified Policy-as-Code

Consolidate scattered policies into a single, version-controlled system. Reference the Policy DSL from `libs/policy-dsl/` and human-readable examples from `examples/policies/`:

```dsl
allow publish resource.topic == "sensor/data"
if subject.device.cert_valid == true
  and environment.network.secure == true
```

### Operational Simplicity

The Tauri UI and click-to-deploy installers make complex policy management accessible. Reference the installation steps from the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md) and the desktop UI workflow from the [Policy Builder UI Guide](docs/policy-builder-ui.md).

### Performance and Reliability

Present the benchmark results from the [Performance section in README.md](../README.md#performance):
- p99 < 2ms decision latency
- < 15ms end-to-end HTTP/MQTT path
- Full offline functionality with deferred audit upload

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

Explain the hard separation guarantees from the [Multi-Tenant Isolation section in README.md](../README.md#multi-tenant-isolation):
- Isolated policy namespaces prevent cross-tenant interference
- Dedicated OPA bundles ensure performance isolation
- Scoped data stores maintain tenant boundaries
- Separate audit logs enable independent compliance reporting
- Independent quotas prevent resource contention

## Demo Best Practices

### Pre-Demo Preparation

Follow a checklist similar to the deployment checklist in the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md):

- [ ] Verify all services are running (`docker-compose ps`)
- [ ] Prepare test tenants and policies from `examples/`
- [ ] Test network connectivity and WebSocket streams
- [ ] Configure screen sharing with appropriate resolution
- [ ] Prepare backup scenarios for common failure points

### Demo Flow Recommendation

Follow this step-by-step script based on the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md):

1. **Launch Tauri UI**: Show the cross-platform desktop application starting up
2. **Create a Tenant**: Walk through the tenant creation form
3. **Author a Policy**: Use the Policy Builder UI to create a data residency policy
4. **Test the Policy**: Demonstrate the test simulator with allow/deny scenarios
5. **Deploy the Policy**: Show the deployment workflow and bundle activation
6. **Monitor Enforcement**: Display the live decision stream and quota gauges
7. **Validate End-to-End**: Execute HTTP/MQTT requests and show real-time enforcement

### Demo Scenarios by Use Case

**Scenario 1: GDPR Data Residency**
- Use `examples/tenants/tenant-eu-manufacturing.json`
- Demonstrate `examples/policies/eu-manufacturing-policy.dsl`
- Show requests from non-EU locations being denied
- Highlight audit logging for compliance reporting

**Scenario 2: Cost Control**
- Create a tenant with bandwidth quotas
- Show quota gauges in the monitoring dashboard

## Appendix: Sample Scripts

### Opening Script

"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I want to talk about a challenge that's becoming increasingly critical in our distributed world: how do you enforce compliance policies when devices are at the edge, networks are intermittent, and data residency requirements demand local decision-making?

Traditional centralized policy systems simply can't handle this. They fail when links go down, they can't enforce geographic boundaries effectively, and they create operational nightmares for multi-tenant environments.

Edge Policy Hub solves this by bringing policy enforcement to the edge itself. Let me show you how."

### Demo Narration

**Tenant Creation:**
"First, let's create a new tenant for our European manufacturing facility. In the Tauri UI, I click 'New Tenant' and fill in the details. Notice how each tenant gets its own isolated namespace - this ensures complete separation between different customers or business units."

**Policy Authoring:**
"Now I'll author a data residency policy using our human-readable DSL. This policy ensures that customer data can only be accessed from within the EU during business hours. The DSL is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical users."

**Testing:**
"Before deploying, let's test this policy with our built-in simulator. I'll input a request from a German IP address during business hours - this should be allowed. Now let me try from a US IP address - denied. The simulator gives us confidence before going live."

**Deployment:**
"With the policy tested, I click 'Deploy & Activate'. This compiles the DSL to OPA/Rego, creates the policy bundle, and pushes it to the enforcer service. The whole process takes just seconds."

**Monitoring:**
"Now let's see it in action. The monitoring dashboard shows real-time decision streams, quota usage, and audit logs. I can filter by tenant to focus on our European manufacturing operations."

### Closing Script

"In summary, Edge Policy Hub transforms edge compliance from a complex, error-prone process into an automated, reliable system. With multi-tenant isolation, sub-2ms performance, and offline-first operation, it addresses the core challenges of edge computing.
